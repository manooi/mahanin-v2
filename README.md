My resume website. Visit https://mahanin.com.

## Note
- This website was originally built with Angular. I check it bi-monthly and recently found vulnerabilities in some of the packages.
- I attempted to upgrade all the packages, but I felt it was quite inconvenient for such a static webpage.
- Consequently, I decided to migrate to plain HTML.
- Using a few optimization techniques, I reduced the bundle size from ~800kb to ~50kb! 😁
